You hurry along the road leading northeast.
Every once in a while you look back to see if
the crogocides are following, but the road is
clear. After some time the road forks to the
right. Up ahead is a bridge that crosses the
river Kree. A new map appears on your screen;
you check it for clues as to which way to go."""

castle looks invulnerable to any force of arms that
could be mustered on Tenopia lsland. A small furry-bodied
guard dressed in a gray uniform and armed with a sharp
spear stops you at the gaie. "Please, I am a stranger
to this island. I need help," you say. After conferring
with some oiher guards, he leads you inio the castle itself,
through a broad courtyard and up winding stone stairs to the
main gallery. There you sit and wait uniil you are so
tired you nearly fall asleep. Suddenly the prince of Agron,
followed by guards and courtiers, strides into the roomr

imposing but not threatening.

Once again you find yourself in the crystal mine, chipping
the walls of the cave, shoveling bits of crystal into a cart
that another slave wheels away. As soon as you have the
chance, you look around. Nearby you spot a cart loaded with
tiny bits of crystal. Taking a chance the guards won't see
you, you burrow in under the crystal chips until you are
completely out of sight. Soon the cart begins to move.
When it does, the crystal chips dig in from beneath you.
Every inch of your skin pricks with pain, but you lie still
and keep from crying out. Finally the motion stops. With
greal care you poke your head above the crystal. You've
reached the surface! Your carl is lined up next to others,
awaiting lransport by river barge. There are no guards aboul.
This is your chance. You quickly check your map.

You are quickly taken into custody and soon learn that your
captors are in service to the prince of Agron. 'Any enemy
of the crogocides is a friend of ours," they say. You
gratefully accept their offer to provide boat transportation
to the prince's castle, near the extreme northwest part of
the island.\n\n
On your arrival a few days later, the prince welcomes
you in a most kindly manner. After you're well fed and
well rested, he sends you on your way with these words:
" l have learned that to reach Zindor, you must find
Chawakelamptha and then pass through Chiga, and then
go south from there. Can you remember all that?"
"l think so," you reply. With renewed hope you sel

After several hours of travel, you cross a dried-up riverbed.
A short iime later the road curves east, paralleling the
cliffs along the coast. From time to time you look down
and see huge waves battering the rocks hundreds of feet
below. You're glad to be heading east, bui soon a cold
gray fog rolls in from the sea. Shivering, you hurry on.
A little way farther, you reach a fork in the road.
Consulting your map, you decide that the right fork leads
to Agron and the lefi fork continues east along the coast.
You would deflnitely continue east, but the coast road is so
cold and foggy you're afraid you'll lreeze lo death before
you reach shelter.

Hiking across the rolling meadows, you marvel al the tall
golden grass tufted with seed pods that glow like embers
in the soft orange sunlight. The seeds themselves laste
like bits of honey-a few dozen of them make a decenl meal.
You're thankful that food is so abundant on Tenopia lsland.
From the top of a ridge, you see a lone zekee peacefully
nibbling grass. Cautiously you approach and then, with a
flash of daring, swing onto its back. Startled, the animal
breaks into a gallop. You clutch its shaggy mane and hang on.
There's no chance of steering the animal; you'll just have
to go where it goes. You close your eyes and pray you'll
survive. The zekee canlers over the countryside for almosi an
hour before it rears up and sends you tumbling into the grass.
Dazed, you look around and start walking.

The people seem to have nothing to do but laugh and dance and sing.
You join in the frolic, but you can't find anyone who can tell you

But a friendly bird child teaches you a little of her mountain language.

friendly with a bird person named Krug. He doesn't seem very bright, but you

"l don't know if there is any such place," he replies. "But it's dangerous to go
east, because you will be in the shadow of the Keona Volcano. lt might erupt at
